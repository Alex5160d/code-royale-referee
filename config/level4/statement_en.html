                <p><strong>Field</strong></p>

                <p>
                    The game is played by two players on a semi-open two-dimensional field
                    <const>1920</const>
                    units wide and
                    <const>1000</const>
                    units high, littered with circular building sites of varying radius. The top-left corner is
                    <const>0,0</const>.
                    The field is generated randomly every game, with the sites being symmetrically laid out
                    (rotationally around the map's center).
                </p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Queens</strong>
                <p>Each player controls a single Queen character, who can establish different structures on those
                    sites.
                    The Queen is the playerâ€™s only way to directly interact with the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Queen is modeled as a circle with radius
                    <const>30</const>
                    units, and moves up to
                    <const>60</const>
                    units every turn.
                    Each Queen starts with a random amount of HP between
                    <const>25</const>
                    and
                    <const>100</const>
                    (both Queens start with the same HP).
                    A Queen will be destroyed if her HP drops to zero -- if this happens, the player will lose the game.
                    If both Queens are destroyed on the same turn, the game will end in a draw.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Structures</strong></p>
                <p>

                    A Queen character can build a structure on the <var>touchedSite</var> that she is in contact with.
                    If she so chooses, a Queen can replace an existing friendly structure simply by building another one
                    in its place (unless it is a Barracks that is currently training).
                    If an enemy Tower is already in place on a site, a Queen cannot replace it.
                    If both Queens try simultaneously to build a structure on the same building site, then only one will
                    be
                    built:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">
                    <li>On even-numbered turns (this includes the first turn: turn 0), player 2 gets to build</li>
                    <li>On odd-numbered turns, player 1 gets to build</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Structures can be built at no cost. Towers and mines begin working the turn they are built, and can
                    be grown over time. Barracks are available for use on the turn immediately following their
                    construction.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Mining</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Each player begins with
                    <const>100</const>
                    gold. A player can increase the amount of gold collected per turn by
                    building goldmines on building sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each site has a different rate at which gold can be collected, ranging from
                    <const>+1</const>/turn to
                    <const>+5</const>/turn.
                    When a mine is first built, it has an income rate of
                    <const>+1</const>. This can be increased by issuing repeated
                    commands to build a mine on the same site, up to its maximum capacity.
                    Mines will automatically collect gold for the player each turn. However, the site
                    will be exhausted of gold over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sites begin with different, random amounts of gold every game. Sites near the middle of the
                    field have higher gold available, and higher maximum mining rates.
                    Gold totals and mining rates are not given for all sites, they must be discovered by the Queen.
                    These numbers will be available for any
                    site whose center is within
                    <const>300</const>
                    units from the Queen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A mine will be destroyed if:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">
                    <li>It runs out of gold</li>
                    <li>An enemy creep or the enemy Queen comes in contact with it</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Creeps</strong></p>
                <p>
                    In order to destroy the enemy Queen, a player will need to build creeps.
                    Once built, creeps follow very simple behaviours (see below), and cannot be controlled by the
                    player.
                    Creeps will eventually age and die on their own, losing
                    <const>1</const>
                    HP every turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are three different creep types that can be built. (The Queen is listed here for
                    comparison.)

                        KNIGHT units are light, fast units which attack the enemy Queen, dealing

                <p>
                    A player needs to build a BARRACKS with their Queen in order to train creeps.
                    A barracks can be destroyed if it is touched by the enemy Queen.
                    Training creeps is explained below.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Training Creeps</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Every building site is numbered, starting from
                    <const>0</const>.
                    A player trains creeps by indicating the IDs of which sites containing a barracks that player wishes to train
                    creeps at.
                    Examples:
                </p>
                <ul style="padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">
                    <li>
                        <action>TRAIN 13 6 19</action>
                        - Three barracks begin training creeps
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <action>TRAIN 14</action>
                        - One barracks begins training creeps
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <action>TRAIN</action>
                        - No barracks begin training creeps.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Every barracks is built with the ability to train a single creep type.
                    When the train commands are sent, the player pays the total cost in gold, and indicated barracks
                    will
                    begin training the appropriate set of units.
                    After the appointed number of turns elapses, a set of creeps emerges from the barracks and begins
                    acting
                    by themselves on the following turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A barracks that is already in the middle of training cannot begin training again until the current
                    creep
                    set is built.
                    Also, such a barracks cannot be replaced by another structure.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p><strong>Towers</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The Queen can also build static defensive structures called Towers as defenses against enemy creeps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a tower is first built, it has a small firing radius.
                    A player can grow an existing tower by having the Queen stand next to it and issuing the same order
                    again; this will increase the towerâ€™s firing radius over several turns.
                    Once built, towers start to degrade slowly. A tower will eventually degrade completely and be
                    destroyed.
                    This can be delayed by regular visits by the Queen, and issuing the BUILD TOWER command again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every turn, towers automatically fire upon the nearest enemy creep inside their firing radius. They
                    deal
                    <const>3</const>
                    base damage at the edge of their firing range.
                    The closer the creep is to the tower, the more damage will be dealt (<const>+1</const>
                    for every
                    <const>200</const>
                    units closer)
                    If there are no creeps in range, but the enemy Queen is in range, a tower will fire upon her
                    instead, dealing

            <p><strong>Collisions</strong></p>
            <p>
                Units cannot share space. All building sites, Queens and creeps are modeled as circles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unit movement is done by simply moving toward the desired target. However, at the end of every turn, a
                series of collision
                checks are performed. While there are any collisions, the offending units are simply translated away
                from each other (except for
                sites, they stay put.) Hence it is possible for a Queen to be "shoved" out of her way by a swarm of
                creeps.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this purpose, units are assigned a weight as follows:
            </p>
            <ul style="padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">
                <li>Site: infinite (unmovable)</li>
                <li>Queen: 100</li>
                <li>Giant: 20</li>
                <li>Archer: 9</li>
                <li>Knight: 4</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In case of collisions, a lower-weight unit will be displaced more than a higher-weight unit.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p><strong>Unit Contact</strong></p>
            <p>
                Two entities are considered "touching" by comparing the distance between their centers, thus:
                isTouching = distance - radius1 - radius2 <
                <const>5</const>
                . This applies to:
            </p>
            <ul style="padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">
                <li>KNIGHT - Queen (damage)</li>
                <li>Queen - Site (construction, and tearing down enemy structures)</li>
                <li>Creep - Mine</li>
                <li>GIANT - Tower</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Site gold</strong></p>
            <p>
                All building sites are randomized in pairs: attributes that apply to mirroring sites are always the same
                at the game's start.
                Each site-pair gets assigned a random gold amount between
                <const>200</const>
                and
                <const>250</const>, a maximum mining rate between
                <const>+1</const>
                and
                <const>+3</const>, and a radius between
                <const>60</const>
                and
                <const>110</const>

                <const>50</const>
                gold and

            <p><strong>Tower HP</strong></p>
            <p>
                Each tower has a number of HP (<var>param1</var>) that determines its effective attack radius (<var>param2</var>).
                Each HP allows the tower to cover
                <const>1000</const>
                square-units (a square unit is not very much!), not including the area of the site on which it sits.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attack radius is calculated every turn according to the tower's HP according to the formula:
                attackRadius = sqrt((hp * 1000 + siteArea) / PI) -- this is measured from the site's center.
                This is so that PI * attackRadius^2 = hp * 1000 + siteArea.
                When a tower is first built, it receives
                <const>200</const>
                HP. This corresponds to a variable attack range: longer attack range for a smaller radius site.
            </p>
            <p>
                When an existing tower is grown, it receives
                <const>100</const>
                additional HP.
                The maximum amount of HP for towers is
                <const>800</const>.
                Every tower loses
                <const>4</const>
                HP per turn due to exposure to the elements.
                Each GIANT that ends its turn next to a tower reduces its HP by
                <const>80</const>. Hence a Queen can slightly outpace a single GIANT by building at the same time.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p><strong>Draws</strong></p>
            <p>
                The game will end in a draw if after
                <const>200</const>
                turns both Queens have the same HP, or both Queens are destroyed on the same turn.
            </p>
