Referee for Code Royale: https://www.codingame.com/contests/code-royale

Just run `Main.java` and then send your browser to localhost:8888. You will be playing in level 1 (i.e. Wood3).

To play in a different league, look for reads of `gameManager.leagueLevel`.
Hardcode it to a different value instead (there is an example commented out in the code):
- 1 = Wood3
- 2 = Wood2
- 3 = Wood1
- 4 = Bronze
- 5 = Silver
- 6 = Gold
- 7 = Legend

You can load any bots you want. See the example WaitBot.java (for a java version)
or CSJPlayer (or any other) for Kotlin examples.

No, I don't apologize for using Kotlin to build this game. My productivity has
soared because of it! Feel free to ask me about anything that doesn't make sense.
